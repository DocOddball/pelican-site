status: hidden
category: proposals

# abstract
Percona XtraDB Cluster is a high availability and high scalability
solution for MySQL clustering.

The session will cover a migration of a Master-Slave setup to a 3 nodes cluster
behind a load balancer. I will cover only 5.6 and Galera 3.
Attendees will be guided during the session and will perform all changes
and tests in a VirtualBox environment.

Attendees should bring a reasonably powerfull laptop able to handle at
least 3 linux VM and have Virtualbox installed.
