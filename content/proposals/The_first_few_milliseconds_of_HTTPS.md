title: The first few milliseconds of HTTPS
status: hidden
category: proposals

# Abstract
What happens when your browser connects to a HTTPS secure site? We all
know it has to do something with certificates, blue and green address
bars and sometimes your browser will give warnings which we normally
click away.

But what actually happens under the hood? In this talk I will give a
step-by-step explanation on the first few hundred milliseconds during a
connection to HTTPS. We will talk about master secrets, shared secrets,
cipher suites, x509 certificates and why secure does not (always) mean
secure.
