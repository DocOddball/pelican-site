# abstract
How to add HA and sharding to your application without changing anything
in it ?!
This talk is about how to deploy such HA shard environment using Galera
(Percona XtraDB Cluster or MariaDB Cluster) and Spider storage engine.
I will discuss different topologies like:

1. your spider main database as Galera Cluster and leave the shards
stand alone
2. spider main database as standalone and shards being clusters
3. clusters everywhere !
