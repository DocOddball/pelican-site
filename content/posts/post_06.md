LOADays is a free open source event. You do _not_ need to register, announce that you are coming.
However you might want to inform to the world about our event.

The Build-your-own-OpenNebula-Cloud day is on Monday 7/4/2014 is also a free open source tutorial day held just after LOADays.
While we appreciate that you register before hand, again this is _not_ a requirement, it just makes our life easier.

For the speakers, please not that you should have received a mail relating to :

1.  Hotel reservations
2.  Speakers dinner

Please take a look at our still provisional schedule online. Check it out :

__Notice: the schedule will still change__
