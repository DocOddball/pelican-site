title: C.R.E.A.M (Cache Rules Everything Around Me) 
category: talk
status: hidden
date: 2013-03-20

Abstract
---------

Don't confuse this one with the well-known Wu-Tang Clan song, but cache does
indeed rule everything around me. This talk will focus on the most popular
caching techniques used in PHP: APC, Memcached and Redis. But we'll also talk
about web and proxy servers such as Varnish and Nginx. This talk is not a PHP
talk, but code examples will be applied to PHP projects
