title: MQTT for sysadmins
status: hidden
category: proposals

# abstract
In spite of being the new hotness for the Internet of Things, MQTT is
very useful for system administrators (and, of course, you need a good
excuse to hear this talk, which is why we say system administrators! :-)
We discuss what MQTT is, what it can be used for and how you can put it
to good use. And we'll also talk gadgets and stuff, of course!
