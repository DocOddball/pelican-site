# abstract
In this talk I explain the big principles of devops culture and a show
their usage for a MySQL DBA.

I cover the installation using configuration management (Puppet) but
also how to test the new schema releases using Jenkins and
Percona-toolkit.
And finally how we can prepare schema migration and automate it in
production using the configuration management system.
