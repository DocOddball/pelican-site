# abstract
Ansible is a simple configuration management and command execution
framework for "push" and "pull" deployments for Unix/Linux systems using
an existing SSH infrastructure. 

It's particularly easy to deploy because neither does it require an "agent" on managed nodes (a newish
implementation of Python suffices) nor does it require a complex PKI. 

We show you how to quickly get started using Ansible for ad-hoc tasks,
discuss some of its modules and introduce you to Ansible's playbooks and
variables. 
We show you how to run Ansible as a normal user (non-root),
how to configure inventory data, and give you sundry tips on using
Ansible effectively. 
If you prefer a pull-based setup, we show you how to implement that as well. We'll discuss roles, use of variables and lookup plugins.
