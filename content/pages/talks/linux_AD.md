Abstract
---------

The presence of Linux and Windows in today's data centers is already
significant, but the trends indicate an increasingly dominating role of
these platforms in the future. Besides being the two most popular OS for
newly implemented projects, migrations from e.g. Unix to Linux also provide
a steadily growing number of systems and significance for the business. So
Linux and Windows interoperability, that is, being able to communicate and
consume each other's services, is more relevant than ever.

This session will focus on two frequently occurring Interop scenario's
between Linux servers and an Active Directory domain:
(1) Linux as a member server, where it consumes AD authentication and
authorization services
(2) Integration of a web application running on Linux+Apache, where Windows
clients may transparently access web applications

Finally, I'll provide an overview and demo of two exciting new features that
are being developed based on Samba 4:
(3) Server-side copy, which can off-load the network when copying files
between file shares, and
(4) "Previous version" feature in Windows, which is provided by Btrfs
snapshots instead of "Shadow copies"
