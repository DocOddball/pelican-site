Abstract
---------

What is syslog good for? What is syslog-ng? And what is new in syslog-ng? I try
to answer these questions and to describe and provide a live demo of new
features in syslog-ng:
- modular architecture
- multi-threading
- patterndb
- correlation
- json
- mongodb
- amqp
- and maybe more as new features are coming out continuously.
At the end I hope to have some discussion about what you like, what you would
do differently and what are you missing, as your feedback is what helps to 
improve syslog-ng into the right direction."
