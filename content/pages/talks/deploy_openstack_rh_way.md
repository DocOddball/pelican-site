title: Deploy Openstack the Red Hat way.
status: hidden
category: proposals

# Abstract
When we talk about OpenStack we usually associate it to complexity and humongous configuration files to change, fill and manage.
Even if we've puppet to help, is not always easy to move around between the various modules and get them working properly.

We as Red Hat, we developed a module called Packstack that help the sysadmin and devops to get their job done a bit more easily.

In my talk I would demonstrate how packstack work and what's the outcome, a working OpenStack installation.

# Speaker
I am currently working on the packstack component for OpenStack that is responsible for the
deployment of OpenStack plus I'm contributing to the upstream puppet modules for the whole
OpenStack projects.

I've developed many webapps beginning with mod_perl and php, and crossed
the river of object oriented programming with Python at first, after Ruby,
Rails and Sinatra, where I found my real happiness.
I'm a LILIK Member (Florence University association for the spread of open source)
and as member I'm involved to the creation of events with Open source and Linux/BSD topics.
Functional languages lover (Clojure as first).
I actively contribute in multiple gems and openshift "redis-openshift".
I give my 2 cents on opensource knowledge with my presence on the ruby,
openbsd misc mailing lists and as a salutary patcher on the pdfcube project
