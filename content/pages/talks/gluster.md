Abstract
---------
GlusterFS represents a dramatic departure from traditional backend storage solutions.

In this talk, attendees will get a technology overview of Gluster and the
situations where Gluster is a great choice, and intro to GlusterFS logic, show
redundancy and fault tolerance configuration, show how Gluster data is accessed by client
systems,

the general admin commands SysAdmins use, and introduce some of our big name
deployments (i.e. Pandora Internet Radio).


Speaker
-------

Justin is a new member of Red Hat's "Open Source and Standards" team, whose
mission is to strengthen and expand the upstream Communities Red Hat is involved in.

He's presently working with Gluster, integrating it with other Open Source
projects, to spread the benefits of low cost, distributed storage to the
widest audience possible.

Prior to joining Red Hat, Justin was a *nix/Linux SysAdmin for well over a decade,
working on mission critical enterprise systems in Telco, Banking, and [can't be disclosed to due NDA :>] types of environments.

Justin's idea of fun is setting up high speed Infiniband storage environments
at home, from parts bought off eBay.  Really. :)
