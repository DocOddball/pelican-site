Abstract:
Relational database management systems exist since the seventies.  Since then they have increased in popularity and usage. Lots of (Internet) applications make use of a database system.
Most of the time this is a SQL database. Its table structure is intuitive to understand and links are made using key columns.

MongoDB is a relatively new, but increasingly popular database system. It builds on the adoption of NoSQL database systems and uses a variant to the new but quickly emerged JSON format for storing its data.

In this presentation I will not only give an insight in the pros and contras of NoSQL in general, but I will also give a brief introduction of the various features of MongoDB.
