Abstract
---------

The ICT world becomes more hostile every day.
For commercial and non-commercial organizations, threats are no longer just
coming from the usual external suspects.
Security unaware employees, delayed maintenance (costs) is also a serious risk.
Knowing this, we created a way in which all our employees could work anywhere,
on any device.
Using (mainly) just opensource tools, it resulted in 10,000++ satisfied
employees, while maintaining and improving security standards, while reducing
operational costs.
