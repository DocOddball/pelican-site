Abstract for the talk:
We're building clouds these days, we can add RAM and CPU power as we want, but
what about storage?

Almost every NAS and SAN has a limitation. Could be the amount of drives,
shelfs, network connections or something else. The bottom-line is, they all
have limitations.

What if you want to build a cloud with 1PB of storage behind it. What if you
want to do that on commodity hardware and with open source software? Then you
probably want Ceph.

Ceph is an open source distributed storage platform which allows you to scale
online into the PetaBytes.

It has been integrated into CloudStack since version 4.0 and enables you to
scale every layer of your cloud.

Speaker
-------

"Wido den Hollander (1986) is born and raised in the Netherlands.

In 2004 he co-founded a webhosting company which grew out to be one of the
largest.

His role as CTO brought him into contact with the CloudStack project in the
early months of 2012.

Wido had searching for the best cloud orchestration software for his company
which could be combined with the distributed storage platform Ceph.

Eventually Wido developed the Ceph integration for CloudStack which lead him to
being a committer and eventually PMC member of the project.
