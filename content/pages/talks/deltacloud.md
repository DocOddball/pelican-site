one of three supported APIs

Speaker
-------

n addition to being the official main front person for Aeolus in the EU,
I'm a Ruby Software Engineer on Aeolus and the Deltacloud project (also Apache
licensed),
with a background as a sysadmin.

I've developed many webapps beginning with mod_perl and php, and crossed
the river of object oriented programming with Python at first, after Ruby,
Rails and Sinatra, where I found my real happiness.
I'm a LILIK Member (Florence University association for the spread of open
source)
and as member I'm involved to the creation of events with Open source and
Linux/BSD topics.
Functional languages lover (Clojure as first).
I actively contribute in multiple gems and openshift "redis-openshift".
I give my 2 cents on opensource knowledge with my presence on the ruby,
openbsd misc mailing lists and as a salutary patcher on the pdfcube project.
