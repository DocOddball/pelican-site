status: hidden
category: proposals

# Abstract
Discussions around linux init system and the change brought by systemd
are quite a hot topic around the Linux ecosystem web. This talk aim to
present the point of view of a sysadmin who decided to fully embrace the
changes, embarking to a journey of adventure, and why he decided to test
systemd early, what small and bigger challenges and changes were faced
and how the story ended well.

(beware, heavy systemd advocacy to be expected during the talk)

# Speaker
Michael work as a sysadmin for a big free software company during the
day, and contributed as a sysadmin and packager for various
distributions during the night.
