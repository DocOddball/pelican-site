Abstract
---------

You have looked at the different public and private Cloud Computing
options for your business but they "somehow" do not fit for you ?

This tutorial provides strategies, recommendations and solutions for a
100% automated IT-Infrastructure on behalf of a private Cloud Use-Case
with the openQRM Platform. The goal for this 2 hour session is a private
Cloud setup which combines and automates standard Open-Source
Technologies across all layers of a common datacenter such as: System-
and Service Monitoring, Highavailability, Security, Server- and VM
Deployment, Network-, DNS-, VLAN and IP-Management, Configuration
Management, VM- and Storage Administration, Out-of-Band Management, cost
allocation and billing. The result will be a IT-Infrastructure which
combines IAAS and SAAS plus the also fully automated deployment,
management and auto-scaling of the Cloud Back-end.

The mathematical function for this workshop:

- automated Monitoring (Nagios/Icinga, Zabbix, Collectd)
- automated Highavailability (openQRM N-to-1, N-to-0 and N-to-VM HA, Linux Cluster Mangement Console)
- automated Deployment (Automatic Installation, LinuxCOE, Cobbler, FAI, Opsi, Cloning- and Snapshot Deployments)
- automated DNS and IP-Manangement
- automated Configuration Management (Puppet)
- automated cost allocation (openQRM Cloud Billing System, openQRM Cloud API)

== 100% Self-Service for Cloud Users
