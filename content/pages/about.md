LOADays stands for Linux Open Administration Days and is also referred 
to as __LOAD__.

This is an event geared towards Linux and Unix sysadmins and people interested in Free Open Source Linux and Unix system administration, configuration and deployment.  

With this event we want to provide a platform for Linux and Unix SysAdmins to get together and share their knowledge and tools. 

This is a free event, and therefore there's __no entrance fee !__
